Certainly! Here's a list of 100 MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) developer interview questions and topics to help you prepare for interviews or assess your knowledge in MERN stack development:

**MongoDB:**

### 1. What is MongoDB, and how does it differ from traditional relational databases?
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, differs from traditional relational databases by using a flexible, schema-less, document-oriented data model stored in BSON format. It's known for horizontal scalability and a non-SQL query language. Ideal for agile applications with evolving data structures and high write demands.

### 3. Explain the concept of a "NoSQL" database.
 NoSQL databases, standing for "Not Only SQL," offer flexible data storage models beyond traditional relational databases. They handle unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data, enabling horizontal scalability and high performance. NoSQL databases deviate from rigid schemas, favoring dynamic schema designs, making them ideal for modern, agile applications.
 
### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using MongoDB?
Advantages of MongoDB include its flexible schema, horizontal scalability, high performance, rich query capabilities, and replication. However, it lacks full ACID compliance for complex transactions, has a learning curve for SQL users, handles joins inefficiently, offers limited data consistency, and may have higher storage overhead due to BSON format.

### 5. What is a document in MongoDB?
   A document in MongoDB is a data unit stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, analogous to a row in a relational database. It can hold diverse data types and is schema-less, allowing dynamic structures. Documents are organized into collections, serving as the core data entities in MongoDB's NoSQL database model.

### 6. How does MongoDB handle schema flexibility?
MongoDB handles schema flexibility by allowing data to be stored in BSON format, which is self-descriptive and hierarchical. It doesn't require a fixed schema definition, enabling the addition or modification of fields within documents without affecting the entire collection. This adaptability suits evolving data structures in dynamic applications.

### 7. Explain the difference between "findOne" and "find" in MongoDB.
  In MongoDB, "find" returns a cursor for multiple documents matching a query and supports additional operations. "findOne" retrieves a single document or null for the first matching result. "find" is used for multiple results, while "findOne" is employed when a single document is expected, such as for unique queries.

### 8. What is an ObjectId in MongoDB, and how is it generated?
An ObjectId in MongoDB is a 12-byte unique identifier for documents in a collection. It includes a timestamp, machine identifier, process identifier, and a random counter. ObjectIds are typically generated by the MongoDB driver when a new document is inserted. They ensure uniqueness across a distributed database system.

## 9. How do you perform data aggregation in MongoDB?
In MongoDB, you can perform data aggregation using the "aggregate" method, which allows you to apply a sequence of data transformation operations to your documents. These operations include grouping, filtering, sorting, and applying various functions. Aggregation pipelines are used to define a series of stages through which the data is processed. Common aggregation stages include `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, `$project`, and `$unwind`. You can create complex and flexible aggregation queries to extract meaningful insights from your data. Aggregation is powerful for analytics, reporting, and summarizing data in various ways.
    
### 10. What is indexing in MongoDB, and why is it important?
Indexing in MongoDB involves creating data structures to improve query performance by facilitating efficient data retrieval. Indexes are essential because they reduce the time needed for searching and filtering data, making queries faster. This is especially important for large datasets and complex queries, optimizing database performance.
